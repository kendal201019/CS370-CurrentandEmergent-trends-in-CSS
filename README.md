In this project, I developed a pirate intelligent agent using reinforcement learning and neural networks to solve a pathfinding problem in a maze environment. The goal was to enable the agent to navigate the maze and find the treasure efficiently. I was provided with some base code that included the maze environment and basic setup for the project. The core components that I created myself included the Q-learning implementation, the neural network architecture, the training loop for the agent, and the code for balancing exploration and exploitation.


What Do Computer Scientists Do and Why Does It Matter?

Computer scientists design algorithms, develop software, and create solutions to complex problems across various domains such as healthcare, finance, and entertainment. Their work matters because it drives technological advancement, improves efficiency, automates tedious tasks, and enhances the quality of life. By developing intelligent systems, such as the pirate agent, computer scientists contribute to innovations in artificial intelligence, making machines smarter and more capable of solving real-world problems.

How Do I Approach a Problem as a Computer Scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems methodically by breaking them down into smaller, manageable components. First, I understand the problem requirements and constraints. Then, I research existing solutions and relevant theories. I design an algorithm or model that addresses the problem, implementing it iteratively while testing and refining the solution. In this project, I approached the pathfinding problem by leveraging reinforcement learning techniques, designing an agent that learns from interactions with the environment to navigate the maze efficiently.

What Are My Ethical Responsibilities to the End User and the Organization?

Ethical responsibilities include ensuring that the solutions developed are reliable, secure, and respect user privacy. It is important to avoid biases in algorithms and ensure inclusivity and fairness. For this project, ethical considerations involved making sure that the intelligent agent's decisions are transparent and that the data used for training is handled responsibly. Additionally, ensuring the safety and privacy of users interacting with the system is paramount.

This project was a practical application of key concepts in reinforcement learning and neural networks. Implementing a pirate intelligent agent to solve a pathfinding problem demonstrated the power of machine learning in navigating complex environments. This experience reinforced my understanding of how to balance exploration and exploitation, the importance of experience replay in training neural networks, and how to apply Q-learning algorithms.
